*NFC Keyboard Emulator in app format.*

This is a wrapper around a WebView that will read the UID of an NFC tag. The UID will be output as keyevents in the WebView, in the configured output format.

## Development
The app was built in Kotlin, mostly because i wanted to try it out. It was more different to Java syntax wise than i expected, but it shouldn't be too difficult to make changes to the app with a background only in Java.

Open the project in Android Studio and it should hopefully just work.
